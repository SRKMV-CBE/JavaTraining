Java Programs - Hands On
========================
1. Set Environment variable for Java (`java`, `javac`). 
	Refer : `setJavaPath.bat` file 

2. Compile and Execute a `HelloWorld.java` Program

3. Practice Programs for using the data types
	`Factorial.java`
	`CheckPrime.java`
	Assignment: Write a Program to list all the Prime Numbers from 1 to 30.
		Different check points : 
			1. Print each number - with the status (Number i is Prime/Not Prime).
			2. Print ONLY the prime numbers - using an Array - using the Array Length 
			3. Observe the gaps and use a counter to loop through the Array and avoid the zero elements.
	`StringLength.java`
	`StringPalindromeCheck.java`
	Assignment: Write a Java Program to find the length of a String without using length() method. Hint: Use the toCharArray() method in the String class that will give you the String as an Array of chacters wich you can loop through further.
	Assignment: Write a Java Program to find whether a given string is Palindrome or not. The program should NOT use any API methods like `reverse()`. But you can use `toCharArray()` of String class.

4. Program to convert an input from String to different data types. Integer, Float, Boolean.
	Assignment: Try the same for Byte, Short and Double datatypes. 

	Assignment : Write a Java program that takes two boolean values as String from the COmmand Line and print the logical ANDing of the value (Truth table, if both are true, the outpout should be true, if anyone is false, the output should be false!)
	Assignment : Write a Java Program that takes two decimal point value (float) from the Command Line and print the sum of those values.

4. Program to pass the input from Command Line Argument

5. Program to get the input from Console

6. Practice Programs with Methods for reusability
	`FactorialArg.java`
	`CheckPrimeArg.java`
	`StringLengthArg.java`
	`StringPalindromeCheckArg.java`

7. Execute a Student Class, with the `main()` method.

8. Execute a Student class and a TestStudent class. 
	Student.java will contain only the Student Attributes and Behaviors
	TestStudent.java will contain the `main()` method

9. OOP - `Person.java`, `Student.java` 
	Encapsulation
	Polymorphism
	Inheritance
